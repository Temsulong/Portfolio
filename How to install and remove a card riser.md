# How to set up a home studio
Home studios have become increasingly popular because of its accessibility and utility.
Despite its quirks, home studios cost a fraction of the price that a professional studio would.
And most of the time the cost of renting out or paying for sessions at a professional studio is almost the same as buying equipment for an at-home set up.

There are alot of features that go 
For any home studio, whether you are a podcaster, a musician or even just an audiophile, you will
need a few essential items. Such as:

1. Microphones:
Microphones can be categorized in many ways. On the basis of sound they can be
condenser, dynamic or ribbon mics. But for sake of cost and functionality, we shall
categorize them into USB microphones and XLR microphones.
USB microphones: These are microphones that connect directly to your computer via USB. It
is the cheapest way you can create an audio source for your set up. They are usually a ready-
to-use system and usually come with all the components necessary for immediate use. That
being said, they lack durability and audio quality. However, the compromises are not too
noticeable and you can easily work with the audio you get. They are a great choice if you are
on a budget.
XLR microphones: These mics provide superior audio and depending on the brand and the
type of technology used they can easily be one of the most expensive items in your set up.
However most XLR mics are dependable and are built to last. They may cost similarly to a
USB mic but they usually do not come with any other components. So, you will need to
purchase an XLR cable to connect them to an Audio Interface, which you will also have to
purchase separately. We shall discuss Audio Interfaces below.
2. USB Audio Interface
Audio Interfaces are integral if you decide to purchase an XLR mic. This is because they are
the medium through which audio from your mic will be sent as digital information into your
computer. They come at all ranges and provide connectivity to up 24 channels- to which you
can connect both mics and instruments. The Audio Interface and XLR microphone pairing
provides the highest quality audio for home set ups and will usually last longer than a single
USB setup. That being said if you purchase a USB mic, you do not need an Audio interface
nor can you use it with an Audio Interface.
Audio interfaces and XLR Microphones are best if you plan on getting serious with your work
or you prefer really high quality content. They are definitely not the cheapest option.
3. DAW
DAW or Digital Audio Workstation is the program that is installed into your computer so as
to enable you to edit and work on your audio. There are many softwares, both free and paid,
that you can choose from. If you are solely focused on podcasting or editing speech alone,
then the free WAV editor Audacity is more than enough for your needs. For music, a more
standard, usually paid option is ideal.
Among the paid DAWs Ableton, Logic, FL Studio and Pro Tools are some of the most popular
ones. Each one has its own ‘ecosystem’ or UI, however they will provide you with similar
results and also support the same VST or 3rd party softwares. You can never go wrong with
any of them but you will need time to learn and get used to them.
4. Speakers/ Headphones/Monitors
If you are producing and creating music then speakers become very integral to your set up.
Along with studio quality headphones, you will need studio monitors to listen and edit your

music. This is because the sound in your headphones, which is very closed, is very different
from the sound in a more open space.
Studio quality headphones and speakers come in all sorts of ranges. However we
recommend choosing ones that provide a neutral sound so you have a clear image of your
sound profile. We recommend purchasing ones from recognised brands or ones that have a
good number of positive reviews on different e-commerce sites.
Do not skimp on these, as getting cheaper ones definitely changes how you produce your
audio. Moreover, it is smarter to get ones that are of standard quality that can last you for
years, other than purchasing cheap ones every now and then.
If you are only dealing with speech then, you can get away with just a pair of good quality
headphones.
Other than these 4 integral items you may need other items like acoustic panels, mic stands/boom
arm and a PC or laptop with a decent processor. You may also require a MIDI keyboard or drum pad
which will greatly increase the efficiency of digitally creating sound into your system.
We hope you have a better idea of the audio equipment available to you and hope you make
informed decisions while building your home studio. It’s not too expensive to create one if you go at
it step by step and focus on what you want to do with your system.
